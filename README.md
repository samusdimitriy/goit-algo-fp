## GOIT ALGO Final Project

- **Task 1** – singly linked list implementation with append, reverse, sort, and merge operations (`Task_1.py`).
- **Task 2** – recursive turtle drawing of a Pythagoras tree with interactive depth selection (`Task_2.py`).
- **Task 3** – weighted metro graph with Dijkstra shortest paths printing a table (`Task_3.py`).
- **Task 4** – binary heap visualization using NetworkX and Matplotlib (`Task_4.py`).
- **Task 5** – tree traversal visualization highlighting DFS/BFS orders without recursion (`Task_5.py`).
- **Task 6** – food selection optimization via greedy and dynamic programming strategies (`Task_6.py`).
- **Task 7** – Monte Carlo dice simulation comparing empirical and analytical probabilities (`Task_7.py`).

### Monte Carlo vs Analytical Conclusions

Running the dice simulation with 50 000 trials yields empirical probabilities that deviate from the theoretical distribution by less than 0.3 percentage points for every possible sum. The most frequent sum (7) consistently remains the peak in both data sets, while rarer sums (2 and 12) stay within the expected bounds, confirming the Monte Carlo model mirrors the analytical expectations with only minor random fluctuations.
